    "The Century Arms US Draco AK-47 pistol is the same reliable and rugged firearm designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in a compact form. This American made AK pistol is chambered for the famous 7.62x39mm. This caliber is known for its hard hitting characteristics and loses relatively little velocity when fired from shorter barrels. The Draco AK-47’s 10.5” barrel is perfect for close quarters home defense or having fun on the range.  The Draco name is well known for its robust build quality and this US build is no different. The US Draco AK-47 pistol features a stamped steel receiver, and chrome lined hammer forged barrel with the traditional AK slant muzzle brake. This firearm has a polymer pistol grip and wood forearm. The Draco accepts all standard AK magazines and is compatible with AKM handguards. One 30 round magazine included.  ",

This rifle represents the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and its logo is inset in the grip cap. This superb rifle is one you will show off to friends and certainly to pass on to the family. This deluxe rifle offers more embellishments and attractive gold Engraving than your average bolt-action rifle. It has a fine Monte Carlo stock satin-finished Stainless steel barrel and receiver the receiver being etched in gold. A portion of the sale of this rifle goes to the RMEF for assistance in establishing habitat and refuge for elk across America. Some of the unique things you will enjoy. A satin gloss finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood. Rosewood caps on the fore-end and grip offer additional elegance. The high-grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks. The raised cheekpiece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope. Durable low-luster Stainless steel to minimize reflection and provide resistance to corrosion. Matte gold etching on the receiver. Quality first. This X-Bolt features a button-rifled barrel that is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy. The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy. The free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately. It's drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform. The adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the human factor by eliminating creep and take-up providing a crisp trigger pull that breaks like glass.",

The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowbacktechnology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. Introducing Walthers patented Soft coil design, The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure fromthe ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrelin front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion ofthe slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside ofa cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion ofthe slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has leftthe barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, openingthe breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.The Walther CCP features a  ambidextrous push button magazine release and a manual safety lever on the left side of the gun. The Walther CCP features an accessory rail and features a 5.5 lb trigger pull for the best combination of ease and weight for enhanced shooting characteristics.

The all new CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an idealcombination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability toconceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowbacktechnology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. Introducing Walthers patented Soft coil design, The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure fromthe ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrelin front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion ofthe slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside ofa cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion ofthe slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has leftthe barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, openingthe breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.The Walther CCP features a  ambidextrous push button magazine release and a manual safety lever on the left side of the gun. The Walther CCP features an accessory rail and features a 5.5 lb trigger pull for the best combination of ease and weight for enhanced shooting characteristics. If you are in the market for a very small and lightweight concealable handgun, then check out the line of CCP pistols from Walther. ",

        description:
          "This NEW! Ruger PC Charger pistol is packaged from Gunbuyer with a SB Tactical 1913 Folding Pistol Brace! The Ruger PC Charger pistol features a glass-filled polymer chassis system which allows for the mounting of standard AR grips. Its chassis system features a flared magwell for improved magazine reloading capabilities as well as integrated rear-mounted QD cups for the quick connection of QD cup capable slings. The pistol also has an integrated rear 7075-T6 aluminum picatinny rail that allows for the mounting of Picatinny-style rail brace mounts. The CNC-milled handguard incorporates the traditional takedown block, features Magpul M-LOK-compatible slots, and a 6 o'clock position factory-installed handstop for secure support hand placement. Easy takedown enables quick separation of the barrel/forend assembly from the action for ease of transportation and storage. The PC Charger utilizes interchangeable magazine wells for use of common Ruger and Glock magazines; reversible magazine release and reversible charging handle; cold hammer-forged, chrome-moly steel barrel; and a dead blow action features a custom tungsten dead blow weight that shortens bolt travel and reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise. CNC-machined from an aerospace grade 7075-T6 aluminum billet, the receiver includes an integrated Picatinny-style rail and is Type III hard-coat anodized for maximum durability. It ships with SR-Series and Security-9 pistol magazine well installed and an additional magazine well accepting Glock magazines.",

Open sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Starting in 2016, Scorpion Pistols feature 1/2x28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2x28 or 18x1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. With a wealth of accessories and attachments available for the Scorpion platform, customization can easily be done with a number of braces, grips, forends, magazines, safeties, mag releases, charging handles and triggers designed specifically for the EVO 3 platform.Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4'' sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants.

The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. It's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.",
