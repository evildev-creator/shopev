Its M300's recoil-proof LED emitter is focused by a TIR lens to create a high-intensity 300-lumen beam with plenty of reach for close- to medium-range applications with enough surround light to optimize situational awareness. This ultra-compact model minimizes added weight, frees up rail space for other accessories, and increases weapon maneuverability compared to larger weapon lights. It comes with an installed click-type tailcap pushbutton switch -- press for momentary-on, press further to click constant-on. The switch is shrouded to minimize the chance for accidental activation.
